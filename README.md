Collection of my Tableau projects

### 1. Sales Analysis Dashboard
I have created a visualisation of the month-wise sales data over one year, product category, consumer category, provinces in a country of a company using **Tableau**. This data was provided to me in a course which I studied. This data set contains more than 2000 data points. The files for this project are available on this link: [Sales project directory](https://github.com/k-bhatnagar/Tableau-projects/tree/main/sales_analysis_project). Here are images of the Tableau visualisation I created and a small snippet of the original data set:
